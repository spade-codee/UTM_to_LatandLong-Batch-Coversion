# UTM_to_LatandLong-Batch-Coversion
A simple progam that does batch conversion from UTm to Geographic coordinates (lat/long)

# UTM to Latitude and Longitude Converter (MATLAB)

This MATLAB program converts UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates to geographic coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) using the WGS84 datum. The program supports batch conversion of multiple UTM coordinates from a CSV file.

## Features
- Converts UTM coordinates (Eastings, Northings, Zone) to Latitude and Longitude (WGS84).
- Batch conversion of multiple UTM coordinates from a CSV file.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2016b or later recommended)
- UTM to Latitude/Longitude conversion functions (included in the program)

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
3. Run the `GeoUTM_Converter.m` script in MATLAB to perform the conversion.

## Usage
1. Place your UTM data in a CSV file with columns for Easting, Northing, and Zone.
2. Run the `GeoUTM_Converter.m` script in MATLAB.
3. The script will read the UTM coordinates from the CSV file, perform the conversion, and output the corresponding Latitude and Longitude values.
4. The results will be saved to a new CSV file.
